    Essentially write a new example that encompasses a couple of the features from existing ones

        -   This means writing a new controller
        -   deciding what to actually do with the api
    

    So, what should I do:

        Simple viewer

            -   Page call to view all your envelopes
            -   Display a simple list of them
            -   Can click on them to view specifics about each
                        -   Status
                        -   who has signed
                        -   etc
